# Panic-Feud

## A project by 3 FE mod 2 students at Turing School of Software & Design. 

### Learning Goals:
* Write a program from scratch
* Synthesize knowledge of OOP, classes, and JS fundamentals to create a playable game
* Demonstrate good GitHub collaboration and workflow within a large group
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application
* Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data

  
### Overview of Site:
  * A spooky take on the classic game show Family Feud.

### Future Improvements: 
  * Continue building out testing suite.
  * Complete the connnection of logic to dom manipulation.
    1. Answers are hidden initially. Flipped/revealed to users when correct answer is guessed.
    2. Finish displaying data on panic round screen. 
    3. Display the end game screen when panic round is over.
    4. Incorporate the use of high scores api
