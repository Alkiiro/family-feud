          <p>Masked individuals surround you in an abandoned building. When the hood is removed from your head, you see someone familiar next to you. You both look dishevled and confused.</p>
          <p>A voice tells you, "Answer our questions, and one of you will get out alive. The first two rounds you will need to guess at the most popular answer. Each of you will get 3 incorrect guesses. Once all answers are revealed, or you each have 3 incorrect guesses, the round will end."</p>
          <p>"The third round will be a rapid fire round. You will each have 30 seconds to guess all of the answers. Incorrect answers don't matter. You can also set a multiplier to your points. Correct guesses get multiplied by that number. Missed guesses will get multiplied, divided in half, then subratcted from your final score."</p>
